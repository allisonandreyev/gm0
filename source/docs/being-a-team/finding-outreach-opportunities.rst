How to Establish Good Outreach in FIRST
--

**What is outreach?**

Outreach is a team’s way of establishing its values for *FIRST* and STEM throughout the community. This can involve activities like networking with professionals, visiting robotics labs nearby, coaching and mentoring other *FIRST* teams, volunteering, and STEM-related activities, and so much more.

**Why is outreach important?**

Outreach is important because it allows your team to demonstrate how it made an impact on the STEM community and spread *FIRST* values. A few awards, such as Connect, Motivate, and Inspire (the highest-ranked award), are all based on a team’s outreach. Outreach usually takes up 2-3 pages of the Engineering portfolio, which is usually 16 pages. Judges are looking for a diverse set of outreach events that have been done throughout the year, and demonstrate a clear impact and Gracious Professionalism. If your FTC team isn’t sure how to establish good outreach, here are some tips and tricks for where to find opportunities.

**How to establish outreach:**

1. Cold email professionals and ask to be mentored

   - This may seem intimidating, but there are many templates online that can help you reach out to professionals.
     Simply search ‘How to ask for a mentor over email’ and Google should provide many options.
     Another option is to ask for mentors in the Unofficial FTC Discord Server and get help and advice there virtually.

2. Research science fairs/events nearby

   - Start by compiling a list of science events nearby in a document or spreadsheet.
   - Local events could be found on Eventbrite, on blog pages, and in magazines.
   - Note the date of the event and whether they allow exhibitors to sign up, and if not, then contact them directly!

3. Sign up to demo at STEM showcases

   - Many elementary and middle schools have science fairs or STEM nights that allow people to demonstrate things like robots,
     coding, and engineering practices.
   - Check out the local schools in your area and see if there are any opportunities like that nearby.

4. Ask nearby *FIRST* teams if they need any help or want a mentor

   - Mentoring or helping other teams is an amazing way to give back to the *FIRST* community.
   - You can connect with a team on the *FIRST* Mentor Network if an 18+ team member makes an account as a mentor, or by asking local FTC teams either online, through social media, or using connections.
   - Mentoring can involve providing advice to a team, helping a rookie team learn about *FIRST*, providing feedback on engineering portfolios, and more.

5. Ask more experienced teams for their mentorship

   - Take note of any very skilled teams in the area and consider reaching out to them and asking for their mentorship.
   - That way, you can get invaluable advice on engineering, teamwork, programming, and more.
   - Chances are, a team would say yes since that means they get some outreach out of it.

6. Volunteer in STEM-related activities


**How to talk about outreach in the engineering portfolio:**
Outreach should be described in a specific way in the portfolio to be deemed impactful. A few strategies some teams have used:

   | 1.​ Categorizing whether the impact is local, state, national, or
     international
   | 2.​ Sharing how many people reached, what kind of people
   | 3.​ Describe outreach in 1-2 sentences
   | 4.​ Sharing how many hours were dedicated to outreach
   | 5.​ Including key images as proof
   | 6.​ Being specific about what the team itself accomplished and its
     impact
   | A simple way to keep track of everything is to use a spreadsheet. A
     tool like that can then count up all the values in one column and
     provide useful outreach analytics for the portfolio.
